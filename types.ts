// This file can be used for shared TypeScript types and interfaces.
// For this application, most types are simple and defined inline or are self-explanatory.

// Example of a shared type if needed in the future:
// export interface UserProfile {
//   id: string;
//   name: string;
//   email: string;
// }

// No global types strictly needed for the current version of the app.
// File created for good practice and future scalability.
export {};
